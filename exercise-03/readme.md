In your local repository, create a folder called exercise-03

Follow the instructions below: 

        Start by copying the code from exercise 2 (both files). 

        In the index.html file, between the h1 tag and button tag add the following HTML elements:
        a div having the id attribute value equal to the string “user-choice” 
        a div having the id attribute value equal to the string “computer-choice”
        a div having the id attribute value equal to the string “round-result” 

        Reuse the code in the main.js file and change it so that the game displays the computer choice, the user choice and the game result in the HTML elements specified above (step 2)

    
        After implementing the solution, commit the changes and push them to the public repository. Use “adds exercise 3”  as the name for the commit.
